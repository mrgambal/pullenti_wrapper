PullEnti SDK wrapper
====================

This project is just a handy (more or less) wrapper for Pullenti SDK.
[PullEnti][pullenti] (Puller of Entities) is a fully-featured NER-library written in C#.
It is free for non-commercial usage so just go and try it.

Code is dirty and, probably, buggy a bit but I don't really care.
Was tested under C# 3.5+, Mono 3+.
